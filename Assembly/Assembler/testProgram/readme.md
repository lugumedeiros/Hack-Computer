This is the Pong game after using the my Assembler.


I have tested Rect.asm, Max.asm and Add.asm given by the course for testing and everything was working so far.
For this pong.asm I have not compared to the source code because it's too long 24k+ lines and the course tool for testing was not working in my machine. I'm using the Pong game anyway because it's impressive.
