This is the Rect program after using my Assembler.


I have tested Rect.asm, Max.asm and Add.asm given by the course for testing and everything was working so far.
For ththe pong.asm that is available I have not compared, the source code is too long (24k+ lines) and the course tool for testing was not working in my machine.
