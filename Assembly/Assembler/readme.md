This is my assembler for the Hack Computer.


There's a better way to code this, but at that point I was too tired already to redo everything. The code is unnecessarily big and mostly of it is waste of computer power.
That said, I'm not a profissional programmer nor have much experience at all, so it's ok...


The program is supposed to create 4 "temp" files and a .hack file. Each one is a step of Assembler and .hack is the end product.

1. tempa.txt: Deleted comments and blank spaces.
2. tempb.txt: Address Labels saved and removed from code.
3. tempc.txt: New variables allocated and Label addresses replaced by respective binary representation.
4. tempd.txt: Variables addresses replaced by respective binary representation.
5. .hack: All C instructions replaced by their respective binary representation.
