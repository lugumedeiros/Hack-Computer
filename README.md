# Hack Computer
 
This is my version of the Hack Computer from Nand2tetris.

The objective of this course was to create an entire computer from scratch.

The Logic was made by creating the necessary elementary and composite Logic Gates using a custom HDL. This means from simple XOR gates to an entire RAM.


The programming language for the Assembler could be decided by the studend. My decision was Python because I'm not experienced enough neither for C++ or even Python. This program became a challenge for me.
